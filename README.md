# Instagram Automation Bot – CBITOSC

This Python project simulates an Instagram automation task using Selenium. It was built as part of a challenge to:

- Log in to a dummy Instagram account
- Search for `@cbitosc`
- Follow the account
- Extract profile information (bio, posts, followers, following)
- Save that data into a text file

## ⚠️ Note

Due to Instagram's strong bot protection, automated login was not possible — even manual login was blocked temporarily. Therefore, the data below is simulated to reflect expected output.
