#Deepgram Speech-to-Text (Simulated UI)

This is a simple speech-to-text tool that demonstrates real-time transcription using Deepgram API (conceptually).

## Note:
Deepgram’s WebSocket API requires a secure server environment and cannot be directly accessed using only an API key in the frontend. Therefore, this project simulates the transcription for demonstration purposes.

## How to Run:
1. Open `index.html` in browser
2. Click "Start Listening"
3. Watch simulated transcription appear in real-time

## Files:
- `index.html` — UI page
- `style.css` — styling
- `app.js` — main logic (simulated speech-to-text)
- `screenshot.png` — demo image

## Tech Stack:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Deepgram API
